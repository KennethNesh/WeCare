 This project presents a web-based application that evaluates the likelihood of autism spectrum  conditions using the AQ-10 test, a validated screening tool. Users complete a questionnaire  consisting of ten statements assessing behaviors associated with autism. After submission,  they receive a score indicating their potential need for further assessment.Built with Node.js,  the application securely stores user inputs—including name, age, individual question scores,  and total score—in a MongoDB database. The intuitive interface guides users through the  questionnaire seamlessly. This project aims to provide immediate feedback on AQ-10 results while emphasizing the  importance of understanding autism. By combining accessibility with robust data handling,  the application serves as a valuable resource for self-assessment and encourages individuals  to seek professional evaluations if necessary
